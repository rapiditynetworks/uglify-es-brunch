# uglify-es-brunch

A fork of the official [uglify-js-brunch](https://github.com/brunch/uglify-js-brunch)
that depends on [uglify-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-es) instead of
the uglify-js@{2,3} packages by default.

This repository has no useful purpose (like many js repos) except that it is configured
slightly differently.  Instead of using this repository, you should use the updated
version of uglify-js-brunch when it is [released](https://github.com/brunch/uglify-js-brunch/pull/41),
and then specify the appropriate version of uglify-js in your `package.json`.
